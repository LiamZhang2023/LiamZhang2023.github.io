I'm a undergraduate student from [School of SECS](https://segs.shnu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Normal University](https://www.shnu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes urban climatology, CFD and GIS modelling, machine learning.

Research Experience
======
I am very fortunate to be taught by [Prof. Li](https://segs.shnu.edu.cn/74/94/c25642a685204/page.htm) from [Department of Urban Science and Regional Planning](https://segs.shnu.edu.cn/81/94/c25642a688532/page.htm) from 2020.06 to 2020.09.

Later, I was taught by [Prof. Liu](https://segs.shnu.edu.cn/d6/6e/c25643a710254/page.htm) from [Institude of Urban Studies](https://ius.shnu.edu.cn/) from 2020.12 to 2023.06, which was introduced by [Prof. Zhang](https://dlxy.hhu.edu.cn/2023/1213/c18030a269419/page.htm) from [Faculty of Geography and Remote Sensing, Hohai University](https://dlxy.hhu.edu.cn/),and [Prof. Li](https://segs.shnu.edu.cn/70/f2/c25643a684274/page.htm) from [Institude of Urban Studies](https://ius.shnu.edu.cn/). My research mainly focas on simulating the wind environment in density cities and saaessing tje ventilation potenticals within ventilation corridors. From 2022.01, I additionally studied CO2 concentration effected by non-uniform underlying surface in urban parks.

Resently, my research mainly focus on stimulating flow fields effected by vertical bamboo row breakwater, which is assisted by [Pro. Zhang](https://segs.shnu.edu.cn/19/17/c25640a727319/page.htm) from Department of Geography.
