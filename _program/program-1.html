title: "Modelling of the wind environment and construction of ventilation corridors in high-density cities with CFD and machine learning"
excerpt: "Urban ventilation corridors can enhance ventilation potentials to a certain extent by
enhancing peri-urban gas exchange to improve urban environmental problems, while
highly heterogeneous urban forms in high-density cities will affect the distribution of
urban wind speed and make the estimation of ventilation potential of ventilation
corridors unpredictable. In particular, complex building forms not only hinder the
efficient quantification of the contribution of urban form to the ventilation potentials of
each corridor, but make it challenging to obtain the spatial distribution of threedimensional wind fields under the influence of complex urban forms. Taking the central
urban area of Shanghai as an example, this paper used computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) method to simulate the high-resolution three-dimensional wind field in the
central urban area, and basically used machine learning method to construct urban
ventilation corridors with better ventilation potentials, in order to provide scientific
reference for the planning and environmental improvement of ventilation corridors in
high-density cities. Specific results and conclusions are as follows:<br/><img src='/images/StudyArea.png'>
On one hand, this paper combined CFD and GIS methods to simulate high-spatial
resolution three-dimensional wind fields under the influence of different inlet wind
speeds and directions so as to explore the quantitative relationship between urban form
and ventilation potentials: (1) A GIS building aggregation model was developed to
simplify a large number of three-dimensional building entities into three-dimensional
building block entities, which has reduced the cost of numerical simulation; (2) The
RNG k−ε turbulence model based on RANS method was used to simulate the threedimensional wind field with 30m horizontal resolution and 10m vertical resolution
under the influence of different inlet wind speeds and directions. (3) The influence of
building form on horizontal and vertical wind fields was analyzed, and the quantitative
relationship between urban form and ventilation potentials at different vertical heights
was analyzed. We found that more complex building forms in the central area could
reduce the ventilation potential of the area, and the ventilation potential was greater
when the background wind direction ws E and S. Larger building coverage ratio (𝐵𝐶𝑅𝑧) 
could reduce mean wind speed (𝑈𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛) and maximum wind speed (𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥) below the
height of 20m near the ground while larger building volume ratio (𝐹𝐴𝑅) would educe
𝑈𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 below 20m. Enhansing normalized vegetation index (𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼), green area ratio
(𝐺𝑅) and water body iindex (𝑊𝐵𝐼) would increase the ventilation potentials near the
ground. The weakening of 𝑈𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 and 𝑈𝑚𝑎𝑥 has a significant impact on alleviating
urban heat islands.<br/><img src='/images/StudyArea.png'>"
