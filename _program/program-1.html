title: "Modelling of the wind environment and construction of ventilation corridors in high-density cities with CFD and machine learning"
excerpt: "Urban ventilation corridors can enhance ventilation potentials to a certain extent by
enhancing peri-urban gas exchange to improve urban environmental problems, while
highly heterogeneous urban forms in high-density cities will affect the distribution of
urban wind speed and make the estimation of ventilation potential of ventilation
corridors unpredictable. In particular, complex building forms not only hinder the
efficient quantification of the contribution of urban form to the ventilation potentials of
each corridor, but make it challenging to obtain the spatial distribution of threedimensional wind fields under the influence of complex urban forms. Taking the central
urban area of Shanghai as an example, this paper used computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) method to simulate the high-resolution three-dimensional wind field in the
central urban area, and basically used machine learning method to construct urban
ventilation corridors with better ventilation potentials, in order to provide scientific
reference for the planning and environmental improvement of ventilation corridors in
high-density cities. Specific results and conclusions are as follows:<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
